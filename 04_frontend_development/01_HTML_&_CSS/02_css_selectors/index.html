      This is a Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
      over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
      College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
      from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
      literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
      1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <span class="emphasis">de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</span>
      (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
      treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
      line of Lorem Ipsum, <span class="emphasis important">"Lorem ipsum dolor sit
      amet.."</span>, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
      those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from <span class="important">de
      Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</span> by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
      original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
